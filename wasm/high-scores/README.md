# High Scores

Welcome to High Scores on Exercism's WebAssembly Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and most addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era.
Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

You may assume that the high score list is never empty.

For the last task, if there are less than 3 scores, leave the remaining return values at zero.
