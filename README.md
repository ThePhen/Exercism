# Stephen's Exercism Journey

[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a place where anyone can learn and master programming for free, without ever feeling lost or stupid.

You can follow my journey [here](https://exercism.org/profiles/ThePhen).

For 2024, I'm participating in their [#48in24 challenge](https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24).

I'm using [this](https://github.com/github/gitignore) to help me set-up `.gitignore` files as I start working in each new language.
